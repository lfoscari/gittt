Gittt is a tool to help managing git repositories in a local environment, the user can link gittt to several Git providers (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc) and then can enter into a TUI environment in which is possible to choose any of the available repositories, this will bring the user to an adhoc folder in which the repository has been cloned, or if the user previously worked on this repository, the folder containing the uncommitted changes.
